/**
 * Factory Pattern is one of the Creational Design pattern and it’s widely used
 * in JDK as well as frameworks like Spring and Struts. Factory design pattern
 * is used when we have a super class with multiple subclasses and based on
 * input, we need to return one of the sub-class. This pattern take out the
 * responsibility of instantiation of a class from client program to the factory
 * class. Let’s first learn how to implement factory pattern in java and then we
 * will learn its benefits and we will see its usage in JDK.
